		<h1>ABOUT</h1>
		<p>This is a vertical scrolling space shooter made by me, for my CS25210 Interactive Web Programming assignment. It's a simple yet addictive game, based around the popular arcade games of the 80s and 90s. You press the arrow keys to move around, press X to fire, and press M to toggle music. Every 1000 points lets you level up, and there's hidden achievements to unlock too.</p>
		
		<p>The menu theme is called "Space Oddyssey (Ambient)" by Dokapi, and the in-game battle theme is called "The Last Prophecy" by SynthR. They are freely available to use from the website opsound.org, which specializes in free, open-source music. freesound.org also provided the laser gun noise (provided by fins) The spites are also from http://opengameart.org. Again, they are completely free to use, and very good for independent game developers. In addition to this, I used the advice blog written by Mike Thomas atomicrobotdesign.com to help build the slide scrolling design, although everything I programmed was made of my own accord.</p>

		<p>This game was made to be optimized in Google Chrome (and theoretically should also work to a similar standard on other webkit web browsers) in a 1366 x 768 resolution, and works moderately well on Mozilla Firefox, Opera Safari and Internet Explorer. Mobile support has not yet been tested. Also, the leaderboard and achievements showing has not been fully implemented as of yet.</p>

		<p>Apart from what I have already stated, the code is written by me, and no public libraries have been used in the making of this game & website. It is based around HTML5, and relies heavily on JavaScript.</p>
